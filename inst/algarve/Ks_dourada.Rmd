$$
Rb(M)=aM^0.8
$$
M=78.3
$$
Rb(78.3)=a*(78.3^0.8)
$$
$$
a*78.3^0.8=203(mg/kg/h)
$$

```{r}
a = 203/(78.3^0.8)
(a)
```
i wanted to use a(g/g/h-1) for this, but r would not accept, so aA=a(g/g/h-1)
```{r}
aA <- a/1000/1000
aA  
```

```{r}
drywt <- aA*2
drywt
```

```{r}
wetwt <- drywt/0.27
wetwt
```
there are 8760 hours per year
```{r}
wetwtyr <- wetwt*8760
wetwtyr
```
```{r}
Ks <- wetwtyr/(1^0.7)
Ks
```
