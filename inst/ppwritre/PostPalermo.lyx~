\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 and

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}(w)=\mu_{0}w^{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Any abundance multipliers, dodgy background and resource setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We should also consider the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}(w)=\sum_{k}a_{i,k}w^{\alpha_{k}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}(w)=\sum_{k}b_{i,k}w^{\beta_{k}}$

\begin_layout Standard
because we can solve the MvF exactly for such growth and death rates, I
 presume, and it should be possible to reconstruct size spectra so that
 (for certain parameter choices at least), we can consider 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
*I'm wondering if it might be possible to get the analytic form of a steady
 state N such that such that aggregate abundance equals the sum of two powers
 (so 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i}N_{i}(w)=\kappa_{1}w^{-\lambda_{1}}+\kappa_{2}w^{-\lambda_{2}},$
\end_inset

 which consists of a combination of two stable_community.R style assemblages
 of background species which use different parameters to each other.
 If we have the case where growth and death are given by sums of powers,
 we could solve the Mvf in this case, and if we have two background assemblages
 which vary over continuua of characteristic size then perhaps we can combine
 them to produce the above size spectrum, the associated death and growth
 rates would also be described by sums of powers, and we can solve the Mvf
 in such a case, and we will have two different solution shapes, but since
 each is associated with a continuua of charactertic sizes, and can set
 the abundances so that the integral over the abundances of the two assemblages
 is the sum of the two power laws.
 This seems to be possible if we make the exponents, 
\begin_inset Formula $n,p,q$
\end_inset

 species specific.
 Indeed it would be good to explore generalizations of the single homogeneous
 steady state construction procedure in this regard, of adding extra collections
 of background species, associated with different exponents, so that the
 aggregation of abundance over all species equals a sum of power laws.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
*We assume 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}=\infty,\forall i$
\end_inset

 so that growth and death are linear, so 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}[N^{1}+N^{2}](w)=g_{i}[N^{1}]+g_{i}[N^{2}](w)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}[N^{1}+N^{2}](w)=\mu_{i}[N^{1}]+\mu_{i}[N^{2}](w)$
\end_inset

 (do we also have to assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}=..=\phi_{s}$
\end_inset

 in order to get the death rates to act linearly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
*It is important to distiguish two different type of steady states in multi-spec
ies hetrogenous size spectrum models.
 A uniform steady state is a steady state 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 such that for any pair of species 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} $
\end_inset

 there exists a rescaling constant 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{ij}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{j}(w)=Q_{ij}N_{i}(w).$
\end_inset

 In this case, we can find all the solutions are the same, if we then set
 things up so there are similar species accross many characteristic sizes,
 then we may be able to demonstrate that we can setup equilibria which have
 something 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* simplified form of transplant principal in this linear case: If 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{1}+N^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M^{1}+M^{2}$
\end_inset

 are steady states, each composed into two parts (with disjoint species
 sets 
\begin_inset Formula $sp$
\end_inset

), and for each species 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in sp(N^{1})=sp(M^{1})$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}[N^{2}](w)=g_{i}[M^{2}](w),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}[N^{2}](w)=\mu_{i}[M^{2}](w)$
\end_inset

 and for each species 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in sp(N^{2})=sp(M^{2})$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{j}[N^{1}](w)=g_{j}[M^{1}](w),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{j}[N^{1}](w)=\mu_{j}[M^{1}](w)$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{1}+M^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{2}+M^{1}$
\end_inset

 are steady states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
*If there are all these extra steady states/neutrality that could be created
 by including extra species with different parameters, then it could be
 quite important to properly model the presence of rare species, which could
 increase their abundance in various combinations to replace a common species
 that goes extinct.
 I guess there there will be cases where common species goes extinct and
 is replaced with a rather non-trivial combination of many other species.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* if you have a steady state, and then you replace one species with another
 new species, at half the abundance which has twice the gamma, and pre-existing
 species have twice the theta preference, for the new species, then that
 will lead to another steady state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* under the further assumptions that phi_1=phi_2=..=phi_s, and [N_1,N_2,..,N_s
 are all proportional to one another], we can actively describe the affine
 set of steady states, by considering the linear algebra problem involving
 theta.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* homogeneous case as a special case of the above
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* special system where all species are identical, apart from that we can
 have arbitrary theta values
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Transplants using tricks with alpha, gamma, theta and A_i
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* demonstrate why we saw a bunch of steady states in our work on steady
 states by converting the code 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* We say a size spectrum model has unlimited intake if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}=\infty,\forall i$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* We say an unlimited intake size spectrum model in state 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 has `power law sum aggregate abundance` if 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\lambda_{1},..\lambda_{k},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\kappa_{1},..,\kappa_{k}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\exists B_{1},..,B_{s}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}(w)+\sum_{j}\theta_{ij}N_{j}(w)=B_{i}\sum_{e=1}^{k}\kappa_{e}w^{-\lambda_{e}},$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists D_{1},..,D_{s},\exists\mu_{0.1},..,\mu_{0.k},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists n_{1},..,n_{k}$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}(w)=\mu_{p.i}[N](w)+\mu_{b.i}(w)=D_{i}\sum_{e=1}^{k}\mu_{0.e}w^{n_{e}-1}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* An unlimited intake size spectrum model in state 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 has `species-scaled power law aggregate abundance` if it has power law
 sum aggregate abundance with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1.$
\end_inset

 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\kappa^{(1)},..,\kappa^{(s)},\exists\mu_{0}^{(1)},..,\mu_{0}^{(s)}:$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}(w)+\sum_{j}\theta_{ij}N_{j}(w)=\kappa^{(i)}w^{-\lambda}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{p.i}[N](w)+\mu_{b.i}(w)=\mu_{0}^{(i)}w^{n-1}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* An unlimited intake size spectrum model in state 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 has ` power law aggregate abundance` if it has `species-scaled power law
 aggregate abundance` with 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa^{(1)}=..=\kappa^{(s)}=\kappa,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}^{(1)}=..=\mu_{0}^{(s)}=\mu_{0}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* A spectrum model is [gamma,theta,alpha,feeding-kernel,..etc.] homogenous,
 if every species has the same parameter/function [gamma,theta,alpha,feeding-ker
nel,..etc.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* A state 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is `single shaped ` if 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall i,j$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists Q_{i,j}:Q_{i,j}N_{i}(w)=N_{j}(w),\forall j$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
*If the intake is unlimited, and the feeding-kernels are homogenous, then
 the set of steady states that can be converted between by altering the
 steady state in such a way that the death and growth rates of individuals
 can be presevred, corresponds to an affine set (the same I observed with
 R.L.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* The above can be generalized to allow different species to be associated
 with different death rates, and therefore to have different solutions,
 but one can still describe the affine structure of the steady states, but
 now it corresponds to a `species-scaled power law aggregate abundance`
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa^{(1)}=..=\kappa^{(s)}=\kappa,$
\end_inset

 and it no longer has single shaped solutions, but by tuning the species
 specific background mortality, we can set things up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
*For a feeding kernel homogenous, unliminited intake, size spectrum model,
 we know how to construct a power law aggregate abundance steady state that
 is single shaped (stable_community.R does this type of thing).
 Using the linearity of the growth and death rates in this case
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* An unlimited intake size spectrum model in state 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 has `power law aggregate abundance` when it has power law sum aggregate
 abundance and when 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}=..=B_{s}=1,\theta_{ij}=1,D_{1}=..=D_{s}=1.$
\end_inset

 This is the standard power law case for which we can obtain a complete
 analytic solution.
 In other words, an unlimited intake size spectrum model in state 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 has `power law aggregate abundance` if 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{ij}=1,$
\end_inset

 and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* A generalization of the above case is to allow 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1},..,B_{s},D_{1},..,D_{s}$
\end_inset

 to take general values.
