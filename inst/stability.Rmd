## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r,  fig.show='animate', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
#library(ggplot2)
#for (count in 1:4) {
#  n <- 10 ^ count
#  x <- data.frame(var = rnorm(n))
#  print(ggplot(x) +
#    geom_histogram(aes(x = var), binwidth = 0.2) +
#    ggtitle(paste('n =', n)))
#}
```


```{r,  fig.show='animate', fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
for (count in 1:4) {
  plot(count*(1:5))
}
```
