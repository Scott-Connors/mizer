We wish to estimate the value of a parameter $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^k.$ Suppose we have a model $m:\mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n,$ and we have some empirical data $y \in \mathbb{R}^n,$ which we can assume is equal to the model output, plus some Gaussian noise, so we have 
$$y_i \sim N(m(\tilde{\theta})_i,(\tilde{v})^{1/2}),$$
where we shall try and guess the parameter value $\tilde{\theta},$ and variance value $\tilde{v}$ used by sampling from their posterior distributions.


The variance can be viewed as a nuisance parameter. We wish to sample from the posterior distribution $p(\theta|y).$ 
Suppose we have the prior distributions $p(\theta)$ and $p(v)$ for our parameter and variance. 

We shall choose the prior of variance $p(v)=IG(v;\alpha,\beta)$ to be the inverse gamma distribution, with shape $\alpha$ and scale $\beta,$ so that we can be assured that the posterior full conditional distribution for the variance also follows the inverse gamma distribution, in the sense that $p(v|\theta,y) = IG(v;\alpha+n, \beta+S(\theta)),$ where $S(\theta) = \sum_{i=1} ^n (m(\theta)_i-y_i)^2,$ is the sum of the squares of the differences between the model predictions and the empirical data.

Using Bayes' Theorem we get the following expression for the full conditional posterior distribution of $\theta$.


$$p(\theta|v,y) \propto p(\theta) p(y|\theta,v)$$
where
$$p(y|\theta,v) \propto \exp \left( \frac{-S(\theta)}{2v} \right).  $$
To achieve our sampling we shall use a metropolis within Gibbs algorithm like the one proposed in Supplementary Material - Parameter uncertainty of
a dynamic multi-species size spectrum model (Algorithm A):

Let us define $\pi(\theta|v,y) = p(\theta)\exp \left( \frac{-S(\theta)}{2v} \right) \propto p(\theta|v,y)$ to be proportional to the posterior.

Let $q(\theta_* , \theta)$ denote the proposal distribution. 

Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm:

$\theta_0 \sim p(\theta)$
$v_0 \sim p(v)$

for $t$ from 1 to $T$ do
$\theta_* \sim p(.|\theta_{t-1})$ 
$r \sim U(0,1)$
If $r \leq \frac{\pi(\theta_*|v_{t-1},y)q(\theta_{t-1}|\theta _*)}{\pi(\theta_{t-1}|v_{t-1},y)q(\theta_{*}|\theta _{t-1})}$ then 
$\theta_t \leftarrow \theta_*$
else
$\theta_t \leftarrow \theta_{t-1}$
end if
$v_t \sim p(v|\theta _t, y )$
end do

We conjecture that if this algorithm runs sufficiently long it will sample $\theta_t , v_t$ from the joint posterior distribution $p(\theta,v|y).$ We shall try and argue for this conjecture by connecting with the theory of Gibbs sampling. 

If one changes the algorithm by holding the variance $v_*=v_1 = v_2 =..$ constant then the Markov chain would converge to a stationary distribution $p(\theta|v_*,y).$ 

I would guess that the algorithm defined above also converges to stationary distribution. If, at this stationary distribution, $\theta_t$ is correctly being sampled by the MCMC part of the code so that $\theta_t \sim p(\theta|v_{t-1},y),$ for each $t$, then, since the code also samples $v_t \sim p(v|\theta_t,y)$ from the full conditional, it corresponds to a Gibb's sampler, and the results in [Multi-parameter models - Gibbs sampling ST495/590] imply that $(\theta_t,v_t) \sim p(\theta,v|y)$ are sampled from the joint posterior distribution.

However, this argument is suspicious because it is not clear the MCMC has time to stabilize when a specific value of $v_t$ is used once.

Now we shall do an example.

Initialization


```{r}
library(mizer)
library(FME)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(deSolve)
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(methods)
library(plyr)
library(reshape2)
library("plot3D")
library(rgl)
library("plot3Drgl")
library(optimx)
set.seed(123)
```

Define model $m(\theta) = (\theta,2 \theta,..,N \theta)$ and generate data $y$ to use to try and back-infer the parameters.

```{r}
N <- 10
myvar <- 0.1
mypar <- 0.7

m <- function(theta){
  return((1:N)*theta)
}

y <- m(mypar) - rnorm(N,0,sqrt(myvar))
```

Define sum of squares and proportional likelihood $K \times p(y|\theta,v)$

```{r}
SS <- function(theta){
  return(sum((y-m(theta))^2))
}

likelihoodd <- function(theta,V){
  return(exp(-SS(theta)/(2*V)))
}

```

Set initial conditions before MCMC loop

```{r}
thetaN <- runif(1,0,1)
prop_sd <- 0.01

myshape <- .001
myscale <- .001
VN <- rinvgamma(1, shape = myshape, scale= myscale)
```

Run MCMC loop (main part of algorithm), and output mean theta and variance (our best guesses)

```{r}
T <- 10000
theta_samples2 <- 1:T
V_samples2 <- 1:T
for (t in (1:T)){
  theta_prop <- rnorm(1,thetaN,prop_sd)
  r <- runif(1,0,1)
  if (r<likelihoodd(theta_prop,VN)*dunif(theta_prop,0,1)/(
    likelihoodd(thetaN,VN)*dunif(thetaN,0,1))){
    thetaN <- theta_prop
  } 
  VN <- rinvgamma(1, shape = myshape+N/2, scale= myscale+SS(thetaN)/2)
  theta_samples2[t] <- thetaN
  V_samples2[t] <- VN
} 
mean(theta_samples2)
mean(V_samples2)
```

Compare histogram of $\theta_t$ output with actual posterior using true variance (blue), and the posterior using the mean variance from our sampling (red)

```{r}
hist(theta_samples2,freq = FALSE,
     breaks = seq(min(theta_samples2), max(theta_samples2),
                                              length.out = 51))



d_theta <- 0.001
theta_v <- seq(0,1,d_theta)
vals <- sapply(theta_v, function(x) likelihoodd(x,mean(V_samples2)))
posteri <- vals/(d_theta*sum(vals))
lines(theta_v,posteri,col="Red")

d_theta <- 0.001
theta_v <- seq(0,1,d_theta)
vals <- sapply(theta_v, function(x) likelihoodd(x,myvar))
posteri <- vals/(d_theta*sum(vals))
lines(theta_v,posteri,col="Blue")
