\usage{
tuneParams(p, catch = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{MizerParams object to tune. If missing, the gadget tries to recover
information from log files left over from aborted previous runs.}

\item{catchdist}{Data frame holding binned observed catch data. The data can
be binned either into length bins or weight bins. In the former the data
frame should have columns \code{length} and \code{dl} holding the start of
the size bins in cm and the width of the size bins in cm respectively. In
the latter case the data frame should have columns \code{weight} and
\code{dw} holding the start of the size bins in frams and the width of the
size bins in grams. The data frame also needs to have the columns
\code{species} (the name of the species), \code{catch} (the number of
individuals of a particular species caught in a size bin).}
