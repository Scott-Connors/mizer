\begin_layout Section*
New MvF PDE scheme 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\begin_layout Subsection*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Idea: Use a formula to solve MVF over small time blocks where growth and
 death rates are assumed fixed.
 Get a formula based PDE solver to get abundance value 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}(t,w)=\frac{X_{i}(t,w)}{g_{i}(w)}$
\end_inset

 over end to end time blocks 
\begin_inset Formula $[L,H]$
\end_inset

 that are sufficiently small.
 Solutions are done successively, over end to end time blocks, to provide
 a, hopefully, more accurate method of PDE evolution than the upwind difference
 scheme currently implemented in mizer (which relied on truncating the Taylor
 expansion for the abundance, unlike our proposed PDE evolver that uses
 a formula to describe the solution over a trajectory where the growth and
 death rate can be treated as constant).
 Perhaps the scheme we propose here is inferior to the upwind difference
 scheme for some reason we have not yet considered, or perhaps there are
 further problems which could crop up with trying to implement the PDE evolver
 we describe here.
 We shall have to wait and see as we have not yet tried to implement this
 PDE evolver idea with code.
 But, it still looks worth investigating, irrespective of its practical
 benefits, because considering how this new algorithm works seems (at least
 to me) quite informative about how information flows across characteristic
 curves, and is influenced by reproduction, and by the initial condition,
 in size spectrum models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This scheme we propose, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

of repeatedly using formula to solve the PDE exactly over small time blocks,
 under the assumption that the growth and death rates are the same across
 the whole block, as they were at the start of the time block
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, successively over many small end to end time blocks could provide improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the assumption of time invariant growth rate 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 and time invariant death rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 the McKendrickâ€“von Foerster equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial N_{i}(t,w)}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial[N_{i}(t,w)g_{i}(w)]}{\partial t}-\mu_{i}(w)N_{i}(t,w).$
\end_inset

 This equation can be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{g_{i}(w)}\frac{\partial X_{i}(t,w)}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial X_{i}(t,w)}{\partial w}=-\frac{\mu_{i}(w)}{g_{i}(w)}X_{i}(t,w)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(t,w):=N_{i}(t,w)g_{i}(w).$
\end_inset

 According to the MathItUpCanada YouTube video on solving partial differential
 equations,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
we can find a solution to this type of partial differential equation by
 equating the following three infinitesimal quantities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}(w).dt=dw=-\frac{g_{i}(w)}{\mu_{i}(w)}\frac{1}{X_{i}}dX_{i}.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equating the first and second quantities yields the equation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $t=\int_{0}^{t}dt=a+\int_{w_{0.i}}^{w}\frac{1}{g_{i}(w')}dw',$
\end_inset

 which can be rearranged to describe the constant of integration as 
\begin_inset Formula $a=t-\int_{w_{0.i}}^{w}\frac{1}{g_{i}(w')}dw'$
\end_inset

 which corresponds to the birth time of fish which is of weight 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t.$
\end_inset

 Equating the first and third of our infinitesimal quantities yields the
 equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $b+\int_{w_{0.i}}^{w}-\frac{\mu_{i}(w')}{g_{i}(w')}dw'=\int_{0}^{X_{i}}\frac{1}{X_{i}'}dX_{i}'=\ln X_{i}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(t,w)=B\exp\left(-\int_{w_{0.i}}^{w}\frac{\mu_{i}(w')}{g_{i}(w')}\right),$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\exp(b).$
\end_inset

 Now, to complete the solution, we write the constant from integration 
\begin_inset Formula $B,$
\end_inset

 as an arbitrary function 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the previous constant of integration 
\begin_inset Formula $a,$
\end_inset

 so we write 
\begin_inset Formula $B=F_{i}(a)=F_{i}(t-A_{i}(w))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}(w)=\int_{w_{0.i}}^{w}\frac{1}{g_{i}(w')}dw'$
\end_inset

 is the age of a weight 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 member of species 
\begin_inset Formula $i,$
\end_inset

 which began life at egg size 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{0.i}$
\end_inset

.
 So, provided we can find the form of our function 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}$
\end_inset

 (which we can), it is possible to write an algebraic description of the
 solution of this system.
 In particular we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}(t,w)=\frac{X_{i}(t,w)}{g_{i}(w)}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(t,w)=F_{i}(t-A_{i}(w))\exp(-B_{i}(w))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}(w)=\int_{w_{0.i}}^{w}\frac{\mu_{i}(w')}{g_{i}(w')}.dw'.$
\end_inset

 Soon we shall describe how to determine the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=t-A_{i}(w).$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(what is the physical interpretation of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 ?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, first, let us define 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}(w)=-A_{i}(w).$
\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in[w_{0,i},W_{\infty.i})\Rightarrow g_{i}(w)>0,$
\end_inset

 we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 is monotonically increasing with 
\begin_inset Formula $w,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 is monotonically decreasing.
 I guess that if 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 is strictly decreasing and continuous then it will be invertible, but anyhow,
 suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 is invertible (at least, over considered values), and let 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}^{-1}(u)$
\end_inset

 denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}(w)=-A_{i}(w)=u$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we can continue our description of how to find 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=t-A_{i}(w).$
\end_inset

 (Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the birth time of the fish which is of size 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\geq0$
\end_inset

 then we let 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)=RDD_{i}(\tau)=\frac{R_{max.i}R_{i}(\tau)}{R_{max.i}+R_{i}(\tau)}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}(\tau)=\frac{\epsilon_{i}}{2w_{0.i}}\int_{0}^{\infty}N_{i}(\tau,w')E_{r.i}(w')\psi_{i}(w').dw'$
\end_inset

 is the egg production at the previous time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau.$
\end_inset

 This corresponds to the case where we have to look at a the amount of reproduct
ion on the previous year 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 in order to determine the size of the current cohort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<0$
\end_inset

 then we let 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)=X_{i}(0,C_{i}^{-1}(\tau))\exp(B_{i}(C_{i}^{-1}(\tau)))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(0,w)=N_{i}(0,w)g_{i}(w).$
\end_inset

 The reasoning for this is as follows, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(0,w)=F_{i}(-A_{i}(w))\exp(-B_{i}(w))=F_{i}(C_{i}(w))\exp(-B_{i}(w))$
\end_inset

 and , substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $w=C_{i}^{-1}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 into this expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(0,w)$
\end_inset

 gives us 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(0,C_{i}^{-1}(\tau))=F_{i}(\tau)\exp(-B_{i}(C_{i}^{-1}(\tau)))$
\end_inset

 and we rearrange this expression to get our recipe 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)=X_{i}(0,C_{i}^{-1}(\tau))\exp(B_{i}(C_{i}^{-1}(\tau)))$
\end_inset

 for choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<0.$
\end_inset

 This corresponds to the case where the `time of birth' 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is negative, and therefore the fish was alive (and in post birth state)
 at the beginning of the [partial differential equation trajectory], and
 it turns out that, in a similar way to how to `time like' 
\begin_inset Formula $RDD_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 information, informs us about the initial condition, by shaping 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\geq0,$
\end_inset

 we similarly have that when 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<0$
\end_inset

 we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 is determined by the `weight like' initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(0,w)$
\end_inset

 we wish to calculate.
 One way to state this relationship is to say that the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<0$
\end_inset

 are chosen so that, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall w\in[w_{0.i},W_{\infty.i}]$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(0,w)=F_{i}(-A_{i}(w))\exp(-B_{i}(w))=F_{i}(C_{i}(w))\exp(-B_{i}(w))$
\end_inset

 and we have that [*need to check this] this turns out to be equivalent
 to saying, for some generic 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<0$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)=X_{i}(0,C_{i}^{-1}(\tau))\exp(B_{i}(C_{i}^{-1}(\tau)))$
\end_inset

 as argued above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the above describes how to solve the partial differential equation, now
 we will describe how this idea could be used to provide a, hopefully, more
 accurate time evolution scheme then the PDE solver currently employed in
 mizer.
 The above scheme is an accurate way of determining 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(t,w),$
\end_inset

 and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}(t,w)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[L,H]$
\end_inset

 and all 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in[w_{0.i},W_{\infty.i}],$
\end_inset

 provided that the assumption of growth and death rates staying constant
 is an accurate assumption.
 There are several reasons why it might be reasonable to assume such static
 growth and death rates over a time block, for example: (1) the time interval
 
\begin_inset Formula $[L,H]$
\end_inset

 could be very short or (2) the populations involved in the 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}(t,w)$
\end_inset

 fluctuations are insufficiently large to have a significant effect on changing
 the growth rates and death rates or (3) the growth and death could be largely
 governed by external forces (like plankton blooms and fishing), and so
 self interaction could be negligible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyhow, whatever the justification, our PDE evolver relies on the assumption
 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}(t,w)\thickapprox g_{i}(L,w),$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}(t,w)\thickapprox\mu_{i}(L,w)$
\end_inset

 that the growth rate and the death rate can be approximated by the value
 at the left hand side of the `(time) block' 
\begin_inset Formula $[L,H]$
\end_inset

, for each time point 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[L,H]$
\end_inset

 and for each weight 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in$
\end_inset

 Making sure that 
\begin_inset Formula $[L,H]$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently small, is one way to make sure that this ``growth and death
 rates do not change'' hypothesis is sufficiently close to the truth to
 justify this approach.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now we have described how we used a formula based PDE solution to get
 abundance value 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}(t,w)=\frac{X_{i}(t,w)}{g_{i}(w)}$
\end_inset

 over a time block 
\begin_inset Formula $[L,H]$
\end_inset

 that is sufficiently small, and this could be used repeatedly, for end
 to end time blocks, to provide a, hopefully, more accurate method of PDE
 evolution than the upwind difference scheme currently implemented in mizer
 (which relieves on truncating the Taylor expansion for the abundance, and
 so loses more info than just assuming constant growth and death over its
 time steps.
 This scheme we propose, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

of repeatedly using formula to solve the PDE exactly over small time blocks,
 under the assumption that the growth and death rates are the same across
 the whole block, as they were at the start of the time block
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, repeatedly over many small end to end time blocks could provide improvements
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So a basic idea in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

repeated formula based PDE solution thing over end to end time blocks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 thing to work, is that in order to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}(t,w)=\frac{X_{i}(t,w)}{g_{i}(w)}$
\end_inset

 we need to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(t,w)=F_{i}(t-A_{i}(w))\exp(-B_{i}(w))$
\end_inset

 (recall 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}(w)=\int_{w_{0.i}}^{w}\frac{1}{g_{i}(w')}dw'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}(w)=\int_{w_{0.i}}^{w}\frac{\mu_{i}(w')}{g_{i}(w')}.dw'.$
\end_inset

) so we need to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=t-A_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[L,H]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w\in[w_{0.i},W_{\infty.i}].$
\end_inset

 We need to determine the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 that appear for the different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=t-A_{i}(w)$
\end_inset

 for points 
\begin_inset Formula $(t,w)\in[L,H]\times[w_{0.i},W_{\infty.i}]$
\end_inset

 that appear during the evolution of the time block.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<0$
\end_inset

 we can determine the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 by considering the initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(0,w)=N_{i}(0,w)g_{i}(w),$
\end_inset

 using the `c-inversion' based formula given above.
 We have already described how to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau<0$
\end_inset

 by consulting the initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(0,w).$
\end_inset

 The other case, which we must describe how to deal with, in order to complete
 the description of the this new PDE evolving scheme, is how to determine
 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\geq0.$
\end_inset

 In this case, since 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq\tau\leq t$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i}(\tau)=RDD_{i}(\tau)=\frac{R_{max.i}R_{i}(\tau)}{R_{max.i}+R_{i}(\tau)}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}(\tau)=\frac{\epsilon_{i}}{2w_{0.i}}\int_{0}^{\infty}N_{i}(\tau,w')E_{r.i}(w')\psi_{i}(w').dw'$
\end_inset

 is the egg production at the previous time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau.$
\end_inset

 .
 One approach (?) could be using the exact formula for the 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}(\tau,w')$
\end_inset

 values, for the chosen 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau,$
\end_inset

 to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 exactly, `on demand'.
 (is there some recursive process that works with exact formula, and looks
 back over generations, to get explicit formula for current condition in
 terms of it ?) process recursively, if one wishes to exactly solve the
 system this, one could try this way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, filling out 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(t,w)$
\end_inset

 can be done by working over blocks, and saving all evolution values down
 to some fine grain time values.
 To save memory, one could just store the initial condition, and keep record
 of the high resolution reproduction RDD(t) data, over previous slots, although,
 actually, come to think of it, I wonder if there is any need to carry such
 discrete data around, I mean, under the supposed assumptions of this PDE
 evolver, we get algebraic formula for how the N's change over out successive
 time blocks, and so we have this information directly at our disposal,
 to calculate at any resolution we wish.
 So rather than a time series, I am hoping this approach could yield a formula
 for the final state, in terms of the initial condition (somehow successive
 generations get re-threaded into the reproduction integral, in order to
 give a description of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}(t,w)$
\end_inset

 directly in terms of the initial condition).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyhow, so summarize, we break the time up into blocks, and these are sufficient
ly small that the assumption that growth and death are held fixed across
 a block is valid, then we can use the PDE solution formula to describe
 how abundances change across any given time block.
 Our scheme may hence be used, much like the current mizer scheme, to iterate
 forwards, although I hope that the PDE evolver I propose here will be more
 accurate because it tracks the way that the abundances change in a higher
 order way.
 However, as I have mentioned, there may be ways to use this scheme to provide
 information for arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $(t,w)$
\end_inset

 by appealing directly to formula, I am a little confused about this (think
 it has something to do with iterating over the reproduction equation, will
 check later), but that is something else to look into later.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is also worth bearing in mind that the interaction matrix theta having
 a peculiar structure (so the population fluctuations from the PDE evolution
 over the block do not have a significant effect on the growth and mortality
 rates, and , so the assumption of static growth and mortality rates remains
 valid).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(It is interesting, if somewhat tangential, to note that, for a PDE solver
 this scheme can be useful, because it allows one to simulate the simulation
 down to as fine a time scale at high resolution quickly, because it gets
 the information about all the brief time evolution quickly from a formula,
 rather than as one wishes (i.e., as one knows about , or cares to interpolate,
 the values of tangential case, is what the population fluctuations are
 among a subset of the population which, for whatever reason (perhaps they
 are insufficiently numerous etc.) they display this type .)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(maybe not, we have to wait and try it first, but it seems interesting to
 think of mizer from this perspective anyhow, since these ideas can be studied
 with analytically solveable cases, and we could use such cases as guinie
 pigs for linear stability analysis, to determine when this `g and mu dont
 change' criterion may occur in more practical situations, but I digress.,).
