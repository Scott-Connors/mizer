\section*{set\_scaling\_model()}

set\_scaling\_model() is a procedure in mizer for making a size spectrum
model.

.

\subsection*{Inputs}

The scale invariant size spectrum model generated by $\textit{set\_scaling\_model()}$
depends upon the following inputs:
\begin{itemize}
\item The number of species $\textit{no\_sp}=s$. By default this is 11.
\item The minimum asymptotic size $\textit{min\_w\_inf}=W_{\infty}^{L}=\min\left\{ W_{\infty.i}:i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} \right\} $.
By default this is 10
\item The maximum asymptotic size $\text{max\_w\_inf}=W_{\infty}^{H}=\max\left\{ W_{\infty.i}:i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} \right\} $.
By default this is $10^{3}$
\item The minimum egg size min\_egg=$w_{e}^{L}=\min\left\{ w_{e.i}:i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} \right\} $.
By default this is $10^{-4}$
\item The minimum maturity weight $\textit{min\_w\_mat}=w_{*}^{L}=\min\left\{ w_{*i}:i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} \right\} $.
By default this is $10^{0.4}$
\item The number of weight bins no\_w = $K.$ By default this is $1+100\log_{10}\left(\frac{W_{\infty}^{H}}{w_{e}^{L}}\right)$ 
\item The minimum weight of plankton modeled, $W_{min}^{P}$ min\_w\_pp
is set to $\frac{\min\left\{ w_{e.i}:i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} \right\} }{\beta e^{5\sigma}}$
by default.
\item The maximum weight of modeled plankton w\_pp\_cutoff=$w_{cut}.$ By
default this is $W_{\infty}^{L}.$ {[}We ensure that the plankton's
carrying capacity $c_{p}(w)$ has the feature that $w>w_{cut}$ implies
$c_{p}(w)=0.${]}
\item The exponent of the maximum consumption rate (also known as the `the
scaling of intake'), $n$ . By default this is $2/3$.
\item The scaling of standard metabolism, $q$. By default this is $3/4$
\item The exponent $\lambda$ of the background spectrum. By default this
is $2+q-n$
\item The growth rate of the primary productivity (the background spectrum),
r\_pp=$r_{0}$. By default this is $0.1$.
\item The pre-multiplier of the community spectrum power law $\kappa$.
By default this is $0.005$.
\item The assimilation efficiency $\alpha$. By default this is 0.4
\item Multiplicative constant for std. metabolism and activity, $k_{s}.$By
default this is $4$
\item Multiplicative constant for max. food intake, $h.$ By default this
is $30.$
\item Preferred predator prey mass ratio $\beta.$ By default this is $100.$ 
\item Width of prey size preference $\sigma.$ By default this is 1.3. 
\item Initial feeding level $f_{0}.$ By default this is $0.6$
\item The size beyond which the knife edge gear catches (if that is what
is setup for fishing), knife\_edge\_size. The default for this is
100 {[}I think this is a weight, and not a length, any may not be
relevant depending on the gear names{]}.
\item The name of the gear, gear\_names. By default this is \textquotedbl{}knife\_edge\_gear\textquotedbl{},
indicating to mizer to setup the fishing selectivity using knife edge
gears.
\item The factor $R_{fac}$ such that $R_{max.i}$ =$R_{i}R_{fac}$, for
each species $i.$ Here $R_{max}$ is the maximum recruitment allowed
and $R_{i}$ is the steady-state recruitment. {[}Thus the larger $R_{fac}$
the less the impact of the non-linear stock-recruitment curve.{]}
By default this is $\infty.$
\item A Boolean variable `perfect'. By default perfect=FALSE. If perfect=TRUE
then parameters are set so that the community abundance, growth before
reproduction and death are perfect power laws.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Procedure}

\subsubsection*{Tidy up inputs and check validity}
\begin{itemize}
\item If community exponent $\lambda$ was given as an input then the exponent
for volumetric search rate $q$ is rewritten so $q:=\lambda-2+n,$
where $n$ is the exponent for max. food intake.
\item If $R_{fac}\leq1$ then $R_{fac}:=1.01.$
\item The number of weight bins $K$ is replaced with the nearest integer
to $K$
\item Let $T:=round\left(5\log_{10}\left(\frac{W_{\inf}^{H}}{w_{e}^{L}}\right)+1\right).$
If $K<T$ then $K:=T$ {[}this is done so there are at least $5$
bins in the interval from $w$ to $10w$ {[}is this true for any w,
or only w=w\_e etc. ?{]}.
\item Check that $K\leq10,000$ and $W_{\infty}^{L}<W_{\infty}^{H}$ and
$w_{e}^{L}<w_{*}^{L}$and $s\geq2$ and n, q, r\_pp, kappa, alpha,
h, beta, sigma, ks, f0, knife\_edge\_size>0 If any of these conditions
are false then give a warning message, and halt.
\item If perfect=TRUE then let $w_{cut}:=\infty$
\end{itemize}
.

\subsubsection*{Define variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set the exponent of standard metabolism to be $p:=n$
\item $\lambda:=2+q-n$
\item Define the smallest weight we model fish at to be $W^{L}:=w_{e}^{L}$.
\item Define the largest weight we model fish at to be $W^{H}:=W_{\infty}^{H}$
\item To round the minimum maturity weight $w_{*}^{L}$ up to a grid point
we let $\delta=\frac{\log_{10}(W^{H})-\log_{10}(W^{L})}{K-1}$ and
$j=1+\left\lceil \frac{\log_{10}(w_{*}^{L})-\log_{10}(W^{L})}{\delta}\right\rceil $
and $v=10^{\log_{10}(W^{L})+(j-1)\delta}$ and we round the minimum
maturity weight up by letting $w_{*}^{L}:=v.$
\item To round the minimum asymptotic weight $w_{\infty}^{L}$ to the nearest
grid point we and $J=1+\left\lceil \frac{\log_{10}(W^{H})-\log_{10}(W_{\infty}^{L})}{\delta(s-1)}\right\rceil $
where $s$ is the number of species. We let $W_{\infty}^{L}:=10^{\log_{10}(W^{H})-J(s-1)\delta}.$
{[}actually is a round() function used here instead ? maybe we should
use the same approach in more places{]}.
\item Prepare to setup egg weights: Let $I[e,i]\in\left\{ 1,..,K\right\} $
denote the index of the weights that corresponds with the weight such
that $w_{I[e,i]}=w_{e.i}.$ We set $(I[e,1],I[e,2],..,I[e,s]):=(1,J+1,2J+1,..,(s-1)J+1).$
\item We set the maximum egg size to be $w_{e}^{H}=w_{e}^{L}\left(\frac{W^{H}}{W_{\infty}^{L}}\right).$
\item Determine logarithmic spacing of egg weights $\Delta=\frac{\log_{10}(w_{e}^{H})-\log_{10}(w_{e}^{L})}{s-1}.$
\item Let $(x_{e.1},x_{e.2},..,x_{e.s})=(\log_{10}(w_{e}^{L}),\log_{10}(w_{e}^{L})+\Delta,..,\log_{10}(w_{e}^{L})+(s-1)\Delta).$
The egg weight of background species $i$ is set to $w_{e.i}:=10^{x_{e.i}}.$ 
\item The asymptotic weight of background species $i$ is set to $W_{\infty.i}:=w_{e.i}\left(\frac{W_{\infty}^{L}}{w_{e}^{L}}\right).$
\item The maturity weight of background species $i$ is set to $w_{*i}:=w_{e.i}\left(\frac{w_{*}^{L}}{w_{e}^{L}}\right).$
\item The value of the reproduction efficiency is set to $\epsilon=0.1,$
although it is overwritten later.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Setting up the data structure}
\begin{itemize}
\item A data-frame $\mathbb{F}$ is made holding the species-specific information,
together with a declaration that $z_{0}=0,$ {[}where $z_{0}$ is
the pre-multiplier of mizer's traditional background death term I
presume{]}, however we do use a different type of background death
term that is described later. The other information included in the
data frame are the names of the species, $1,..,s$ and w\_min, w\_inf,
w\_mat, w\_min\_idx, h, ks, beta, sigma, alpha, erepro, sel\_func
= \textquotedbl{}knife\_edge\textquotedbl{}, knife\_edge\_size = knife\_edge\_size,
gear = gear\_names.
\item A mizer params object $\mathbb{P}$ is made by using $\mathbb{F}$
and $p,n,q,\lambda,f_{0},\kappa,W^{L},W^{H},K,W_{min}^{P},w_{cut},r_{0}$
as inputs to MizerParams(). Here $W_{min}^{P}$ is the minimum weight
of plankton modeled, and $r_{0}$ is the replenishment rate of the
plankton. The values of $\gamma,w$ and $dw$ are (re)computed by
calling MizerParams(), and we use such updated values.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Steady state solution for species one}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute coefficient of predation death rate that would be induced
by a power law spectrum of background species: $\mu_{0}:=(1-f_{0})\sqrt{2\pi}\kappa\gamma\sigma\beta^{n-1}\exp\left(\sigma^{2}(n-1)^{2}/2\right)$
\item Compute coefficient of energy available for reproduction and growth,
at power law state $\hbar:=\alpha hf_{0}-k_{s}.$ If $\hbar<0$ then
halt.
\item We define pow=$B:=\frac{\mu_{0}}{\hbar(1-n)},$ and if $B<1$ then
an error message is displayed about how at steady state the ratio
of death rate to growth rate is too small, leading to an accumulation
of fish at their largest size.{[}check the 1-n really goes on the
denominator{]}.
\item The death rate at steady state is $\mu(w):=\mu_{0}w^{n-1}$
\item The growth rate of species $1$ at steady state is $g(w):=\hbar w^{n}(1-\psi_{1}(w)),$
where $\psi_{1}(w)$ is the fraction of their energy that a weight
$w$ member of species $1$ diverts to reproduction.
\item Let $I[\infty,i]$ denote the index such that $w_{I[\infty,i]}=W_{\infty.i}$,
that gives the asymptotic weight of the $i$th species. Let $\mathbb{I}=\left\{ 1,2,..,I[\infty,1]-1\right\} $
\item The unscaled steady state abundance $\widehat{N_{1}}(w)$ of species
$1$ is such that $\widehat{N_{1}}(w_{1})=1,$ and for each $j\in\left\{ 2,..,K\right\} $
we have that $\widehat{N_{1}}(w_{j})=0$ if $j>I[\infty,1]$ and otherwise,
$(\widehat{N_{1}}(w_{1}),\widehat{N_{1}}(w_{2}),\widehat{N_{1}}(w_{3}),..,\widehat{N_{1}}(w_{K}))$
is set equal to $(1,H[1],H[2],..,H[I[\infty,1]-1],0,0,..,0)$. Here
$H[k]==\Pi_{u=1}^{k}\frac{g(w_{u})}{g(w_{u+1})+\mu(w_{u+1})dw_{u+1}}$
{[}This is to match with the steady state of the upwind difference
scheme, but I'd better check I've got the indices correct, etc., and
simplify{]}.
\item Rescale the abundance of species $1$ so it lies on a power law. Let
$M=\kappa/\sum_{j=1}^{I[\infty,1]}\widehat{N_{1}}(w_{j})w_{j}^{\lambda-1}dw_{j}$
be the multiplier, and generate the properly scaled abundance of species
$1,$ which we set to be $N_{1}^{*}(w):=\widehat{N_{1}}(w)(10^{\Delta(1-\lambda)/2}-10^{-\Delta(1-\lambda)/2})M/(1-\lambda).$
{[}I am not sure where the $(10^{\Delta(1-\lambda)/2}-10^{-\Delta(1-\lambda)/2})$
renormalization factor comes from{]}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Finish computing steady state solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Initially set $N_{i}(w_{j})=0$
\item For each species $i\in\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} $ let $I[e,i]$ be the
egg weight index, so $w_{I[e,i]}=w_{e.i}$ and the list of indices
which we shall fill abundance values into is $\mathbb{I}=\left(I[e,i],I[e,i]+1,..,I[e,i]+\left\Vert N_{1}^{*}()\right\Vert -1\right),$
where $\left\Vert N_{1}^{*}()\right\Vert =I[\infty,1]$ is the number
of size bins that get (potentially) non-zero abundance values loaded
into them, during the previous construction of the steady state solution.
\item Now we use our scale invariant transformation to construct the steady
state abundance of the $i$th species. This is done by setting $N_{i}(w_{\mathbb{I}[k]})=N_{1}^{*}(w_{k})\left(\frac{w_{e.1}}{w_{e.i}}\right)^{\lambda}$
for each $k\in\left\{ 1,..,|\mathbb{I}|\right\} ,$ where $|\mathbb{I}|$
is the number of indices in our list. 
\item We compute the community spectrum $N_{c}(w):=\sum_{i=1}^{s}N_{i}(w)$
and save it as part of the MizerParams object $\mathbb{Q}$ that we
will return from this procedure. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Setup Plankton}
\begin{itemize}
\item Define the `plankton vector' to be $N^{P}(w)=\kappa w^{-\lambda}-N_{c}(w)$
to be the required abundance to fill up to the power law, over the
interval of weights where fish are modeled. 
\item Cutoff the plankton vector above $w_{cut}$ so if $w\geq w_{cut}$
then $N^{P}(w)=0.$ If perfect=FALSE then any negative entries generated
in $N^{P}(w)$ are replaced with zeros.
\item Let the abundance of plankton (that will be) at steady state $N_{R}(w')$
be replaced with $N^{P}(w')$ for each weight $w'$ in the fish weight
interval.
\item The carrying capacity $c_{p}(w)$ is defined from the minimum plankton
weight, all the way to the maximum fish size. For the weights $w'$
over the sizes at which fish are modeled we set $c_{p}(w')=N^{P}(w')\frac{r(w')+\mu_{R}(w')}{r(w')}$
where $r(w)=r_{0}w^{p-1}$ is the replenishment rate of the plankton,
and $\mu_{R}(w'$) is the death rate on the plankton, in the presence
of fish with abundance as described by $N_{i}(w).$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Setup background death}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $\mu_{P.i}(w)$ be the predation mortality rate.
\item For each species $i$ set the background death to be $\mu_{B.i}(w)=\mu_{0}w^{n-1}-\mu_{P.i}(w),$
and if perfect=FALSE then replace negative background death values
with zeros. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Make egg count match newborn abundance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $R_{p.i}=\frac{\epsilon}{2w_{e.i}}\int_{0}^{\infty}N_{i}(w)E_{r.i}(w)\psi_{i}(w)dw$
denote the total production of eggs for breeders of species $i$.
\item Let $g_{i}(w)$ be the growth rate of species $i$
\item Let $\mu_{i}(w)$ be the total death rate of species $i$ 
\item For each species $i,$ we replace the value of the reproductive efficiency
with the value $\epsilon_{i}^{*}=\epsilon_{i}N_{i}(w_{e.i})(g_{i}(w_{e.i})+dw_{I[e.i]}\mu_{i}(w_{e.i}))/R_{p.i}$
where $\epsilon_{i}$ is the old value of the reprodution efficiency. 
\item If $R_{fac}=\infty$ then $\epsilon_{i}^{*}$ is used as the value
of the reproduction efficiency. Otherwise, if $R_{fac}$ is finite
then the final value of the reproduction efficiency is $\left(\frac{R_{fac}}{R_{fac}-1}\right)\epsilon_{i}^{*}.$
This is to compensate for using a stock recruitment relationship. 
\item Add $N_{R}(w),N_{i}(w),\epsilon$ to our MizerParams object $\mathbb{P}$ 
\item Use these values to find $R_{p.i}^{*}=\frac{\epsilon}{2w_{e.i}}\int_{0}^{\infty}N_{i}(w)E_{r.i}(w)\psi_{i}(w)dw$
and reset the stock recruitment relationship so $R_{max.i}=(R_{fac}-1)R_{p.i}^{*}.${[}am
a bit confused about rfac{]}
\item Return $\mathbb{P}$
\end{itemize}

\section*{retune\_abundance()}

\subsubsection*{Inputs}
\begin{itemize}
\item A MizerParams object $\mathbb{P}$
\item A Boolean vector called `retune', that determines whether a species
can be retuned or not. Let $L\subseteq\left\{ 1,..,s\right\} $ denote
the set of species $i$ that we want to retune the abundance multipliers
of, to make the aggregate abundance fit the power law.
\item A cutoff value $C.$ A species $i$ with an abundance $N_{i}(w_{*i})$
at maturity size $w_{*i}$ will be removed if $N_{i}(w_{*i})<CN_{C}(w),$
where $N_{C}(w)=\sum_{i=1}^{s}N_{i}(w)$. The default value is $10^{-3}.$ 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item If no species $i$ are such that retune{[}i{]}=TRUE then return $\mathbb{P}$
and halt. 
\item Let $\mathbb{I}^{L}$ and $\mathbb{I}^{H}$ be the weight indices
such that $w[\mathbb{I}^{L}]=\min\left\{ w_{*i}\right\} $ and $w[\mathbb{I}^{H}]=\max\left\{ W_{\infty.i}\right\} $
that are the limits between which we try to match the near power law
$N_{C}(w)$ with the aggregate renormalized species abundance curves
between the maturity size of the smallest species and the maximum
size of the largest species. More precisely, we find the abundance
multipliers $A_{i}$ so that the integral of the square of the relative
$\left(\sum_{i\notin L}A_{i}N_{i}(w)+\sum_{i\in L}N_{i}(w)-N_{C}(w)\right)/N_{C}(w)$
over w, between our limits, is minimized, where $L$ is the set of
all retuneable species.
\item We just focus on the set $S\subset\left\{ 1,..,K\right\} $ of weight
indices $k$ such that $N_{C}(w_{k})>0.$ Let $\rho=\text{\ensuremath{\sum}}_{i\in\left\{ 1,..,K\right\} -S}N_{i}(w)$
be the aggregate abundance of species that will not be retuned (using
the mizer state saved with $\mathbb{P}$).
\item Construct an $\left|L\right|\times\left|S\right|$ matrix $M$ such
that for $i\in\left\{ 1,..,\left|L\right|\right\} $ and $j\in\left\{ 1,..,\left|S\right|\right\} $
let $M_{i,j}=\frac{N_{L[i]}(w_{S[j]})}{N_{C}(w_{S[j]})}$.
\item Let $b(w)=(N_{C}(w)-\rho)/N_{C}(w).$
\item Apply singular value decomposition {[}I should read Numerical Recipes
section 15.4.2 to better understand{]} to $M$. Let $d$ be a vector
containing the singular values of $A$, sorted in decreasing order.
Let $\overline{d}=\left(1/d_{1},1/d_{2},..,\right)$ denote the inverses
of the singular values. Let $u$ and $v$ be the associated variables
from the singular value decomposition. We exclude entries from $\overline{d}$
over $10^{8}.$ 
\item For the $i$th retunnable species $L[i]$ we have that the abundance
multiplier that should be used is $A_{L[i]}^{*}=x_{i}$ where $x=yu^{T}b$
and $y_{ij}=v_{ij}\overline{d}_{i}$. {[}I want to understand this
better{]}.
\item Remove any species $i$ such that $N_{i}(w_{*i})<CN_{C}(w),$ where
$C$ is the cutoff. 
\item Return the resulting MizerParams object, with the newly setup near
steady state.
\end{itemize}
{[}I am wondering if the code could be improved by adding a function
that retunes the abundance multipliers so that the death rates are
like those in the scale invariant system. A viable modelling philosophy
might be to begin by setting up the real world model, with proper
fishing etc., but in the initial model, just initially use background
species, setup to look like an average fish in the system. Then we
can add the explicit species. We already have a function that retunes
the abundance multipliers of the background species to get a power
law and ensure (among other things) that the background species experience
the same growth rates in the new, heterogeneous system, as they did
in the original, purely scale invariant system. I think it might be
a good idea to include an extra procedure, that retunes the abundance
multipliers of the background species to try and make it so that background
species experience the same death rates as they did in the original
system. So basically I am saying, if we get a `pure background' model
setup properly first, then we could try and add the explicit species
in such a way that the species in the pure background system experience
the same growth and death rates as they did in the `pure background'
model. Perhaps this idea is misguided, or in some way I have not fathomed
yet, we are already doing it. I will be able to say more when I have
finished the code review. Also, preserving the death rates of the
background species corresponds with an extra constraint that we may
not want to have, and there could be a tricky aspect to joint optimizing
over the growth and death rates. Anyhow, I'm not sure if this could
help us improve the accuracy of our growth rates and SSB values{]}

{[}I wonder if it could be helpful to add another procedure morph(P,Q)
to mizer, that takes a system with parameters P, at steady state S,
and Quasi-continuously deforms the system from P to system with parameters
Q, along the line from P to Q in parameter space, while keeping track
of the steady state using steady(). I wonder if we could make the
step size involved in the deformation variable to ensure that steady()
has the best change of successfully tracking the steady state.{]}

\section*{addSpecies()}

\subsubsection*{Inputs}
\begin{itemize}
\item A MizerParams object $\mathbb{P}$ for the system we want to add species
to
\item A dataframe $\mathbb{F}$ of parameters of the species we want to
add. 
\item A vector $S_{B}$ where $S_{B.i}$ is the target spawning stock biomass
(SSB) of species $i.$ By default these are not specified.
\item A value of $R_{fac}$ that determines the strength of the non-linearity
in the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship. The maximal recruitment
will be set to $R_{fac}$ times the normal steady-state recruitment.
Default is $10.$
\item The fishing effort $e,$ default value is $0.$ 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Check paramaters are valid }
\begin{itemize}
\item If $R_{fac}\leq1$ then change it to $1.01.$
\item Check no species are being added that are the same as those which
are already there.
\item Set the reproduction efficiency $\epsilon=0.1$
\item Include line type and line color of species, from $\mathbb{F}$ into
the output MizerParams object $\mathbb{Q}.$ Fill out any missing
columns of $\mathbb{F}$ with NAs (`not available' markers), and similarly
fill out the dataframe of $\mathbb{P.}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Make data structure for combined system }
\begin{itemize}
\item Combine the dataframe $\mathbb{F}$ with the dataframe of the original
system $\mathbb{P}$ to get a new dataframe $\mathbb{F}'$ that holds
data on all species.
\item Use the combined dataframe $\mathbb{F}'$ together with the values
p, n, q, lambda, f0, kappa, min\_w, max\_w, no\_w, min\_w\_pp , w\_pp\_cutoff
and $r_{0}$ {[}as extracted from rr\_pp{]} and from the original
mizer params object $\mathbb{P}$.
\item Use the plankton carrying capacity and plankton abundance $N_{R}(w)$
from $\mathbb{P}.$ {[}dont we have to re-adjust the plankton abundance
?{]}. Add this data to the output $\mathbb{Q}$
\item Let $s+1$ be the index of the new species, and let $s^{*}=s+1$ be
the number of species in the output $\mathbb{Q}$. {[}earlier the
code suggested that multiple species were being added simultaineously,
but actually only one species is being added{]}.
\item For each original species $i\in\left\{ 1,..,s^{*}-1\right\} ,$ set
the abundance $N_{i}(w)$ of $i$ (associated with the output $\mathbb{Q})$
initially equal to its abundance in the original system $\mathbb{P}.$ 
\item Pass the values $N_{C}(w)$ and $\psi_{i}(w),$ and $\mu_{b.i}(w)$
and the stock recruitment function (srr), from the original MizerParams
object $\mathbb{P}$ into the output $\mathbb{Q}.$ Set the background
death for the new species to be the same as the one for the first
species in $\mathbb{P}.$ {[}we are basically assuming the background
death terms are the same for the different species, so maybe there
should be a check for this. Also, I'm so far a bit unclear how the
psi value gets filled in for the new species. Also, I guess srr will
be rewritted when we have changed erepro, rfac,rmax{]}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Find near steady conditions for new species}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set self interaction $\theta_{s*s*}=0$, of the new species to zero,
so we can determine the growth rates, and death rates induced upon
it by the pre-existing species.
\item Compute the total death rate for new species $\mu_{s*}(w),$ and the
growth rate $g_{s*}(w)$ for the new species, in the system with pre-existing
species as previously setup.
\item Let $\mathbb{I}[\infty]$ denote the weight index such that $w_{\mathbb{I}[\infty]}=W_{\infty.s*}$
, this is the index of the asymptotic weight of the new species. 
\item Let $\mathbb{I}=\left(\mathbb{I}[e,s^{*}],\mathbb{I}[e,s^{*}]+1,..,\mathbb{I}[\infty]-1\right)$
be the weight indices upon which we shall fill in the new species
abundace. If $g_{s*}(w_{k})=0$ for any $k\in\mathbb{I}$ then halt,
because algorithm would encounter division by zero. {[}do we do this
when we solve scale invariant system ?{]}
\item Initially fill out the near steady solution $N_{s*}(w)$ with zeros.
\item Let $\mathbb{H}=\left(I[e,s*],I[e,s*]+1,..,I[\infty,s*]\right)$ denotes
the weight indices we shall fill out non-zero values to. 
\item For each $k\in\left\{ 1,..,\left|\mathbb{H}\right|\right\} $ let
$N_{s*}(w[\mathbb{H}_{k}]):=U_{k}$ where $\left(U_{1},U_{2},..,U_{\left|\mathbb{H}\right|}\right)=\left(1,V_{1},V_{2},..,V_{\mathbb{\left|H\right|}-1}\right)$
where $V_{k}=\Pi_{u=1}^{k}\frac{g(w[\mathbb{I}_{u}])}{g(w[\mathbb{I}_{u+1}])+\mu(w[\mathbb{I}_{u+1}])dw[\mathbb{I}_{u+1}]}$.
This is solving for a steady condition under the Mckendrick von Foerster
equation. Check that this candidate steady state does not hold any
infinities or non-numerical values. 
\item If the spawning stock biomass $S_{B}$ of the new species $s^{*}$
is not specified then normalise the new species steady state solution
so that at its maximum it lies at half the power law, and then calculate
its SSB. We choose the maximum of the biomass density in log space
because that is always an increasing function at small size. Let $\mathbb{I}$
be the weight index that maximizes $N_{s*}(w_{\mathbb{I}})w_{\mathbb{I}}^{\lambda}$
and re-normalize the solution to be $N_{s*}(w_{i}):=N_{s*}(w_{i})\kappa w_{\mathbb{I}}^{-\lambda}/(2N_{s*}(w_{\mathbb{I}})),$
and record the resulting stock spawning biomass $SSB:=\sum_{k}N_{s*}(w_{k})w_{k}\psi_{s*}(w_{k})dw_{k}$.
Alternatively, if the spawning stock biomass $S_{B}$ of the new species
$s^{*}$ is $N_{s*}(w_{i}):=N_{s*}(w_{i})SSB/SSB^{*}.$
\item The SSB values are recorded as part of a vector A in the output $\mathbb{Q}.$
\item Reset the self interaction value of $\theta_{s*s*}:=1$ {[}did we
check theta started out all ones ?{]}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Finish setting up new steady state}
\begin{itemize}
\item Apply retune() to recreate the aggregate abundance spectrum of the
old params object, allowing all the abundance multipliers to vary
in free/background species, as indicated by the vector A which describes
which SSB values are known. {[}maybe we could use less names for these
things{]}.
\item Reset the reproduction efficiency $\epsilon_{i}:=\epsilon_{i}N_{i}(w_{e.i})(g_{i}(w_{e.i})+dw_{I[e,i]}+\mu(w_{e.i}))/R_{p.i}$
as long as unmodified reproductive output $R_{p.i}$ is non-zero,
in which case set $\epsilon_{i}:=0.1.$ 
\item Rewrite the reproduction efficiency to be $\epsilon_{i}:=\epsilon_{i}/(1-1/R_{fac})$
{[}again I have to better understand this rfac stuff{]}.
\item $R_{max.i}=(R_{fac}-1)R_{p.i}^{*}$ where $R_{p.i}^{*}$ is the recalculated
reproductive output. 
\item Gather data and output it as MizerParams object $\mathbb{Q}.$
\end{itemize}
